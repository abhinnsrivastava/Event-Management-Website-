I created a multi-page Event Management Website as part of my web development learning journey.
Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it includes a login system, booking form, event showcase, interactive gallery, and testimonial section.
This project helped me strengthen my fundamentals in frontend development, responsive design, and user interface creation.
It reflects my progress and passion for building clean, functional web experiences.
